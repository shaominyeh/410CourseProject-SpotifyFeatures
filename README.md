## Project Overview

This project consists of three different models regarding songs from a Spotify dataset all encapsulated by a Flask application. The TF-IDF Search Engine model takes a user-submitted query and outputs the most similar songs based on TF-IDF weighting. The Similar Songs model takes a user-submitted song and outputs the most similar songs based on TF-IDF and musical features. The Sentiment Analysis model takes a user-submitted song and outputs the sentiment analysis based on that song.
